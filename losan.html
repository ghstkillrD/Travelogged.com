	Downtown
The central business district and home to the Grand Avenue cultural corridor. The advent of the automobile and freeways led to the neighborhood's slow decline, but it has seen a booming revival in recent years, led by new residential buildings, with trendy hotels, bars, shops and restaurants.
Eastside
A funkier area north of downtown and east of Hollywood that is rapidly gentrifying.
Harbor Area
Home of the largest sea port in the US and the launching point for trips to Catalina Island.
Hollywood
A very affluent part of the city, and the place where movies are made (or to be accurate, were made). It has received quite a makeover in recent years, sparked by the construction of Hollywood & Highland and the return of the Academy Awards.
San Fernando Valley
The northern suburban portion of Los Angeles, lying in a valley northwest of downtown, containing various districts, and mostly residential.
South Central
It's long had a reputation for gang violence and it is famed for the Rodney King riots. But while it remains off most people's radar, there are things to see, such as the museums of Exposition Park, as the area slowly attempts to repair its bruised image.
Westside
Generally more affluent corridor within the city limits that lies between downtown Los Angeles and the ocean. It has a lot of upscale restaurants, shopping malls, and movie theaters.
Wilshire
Home of the historic architecture of the Miracle Mile District, the Farmer's Market and The Grove shopping areas, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Koreatown, CBS Television City, and the famous La Brea Tar Pits.
