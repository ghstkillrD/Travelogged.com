Belarus is a country situated in the geographical center of Europe, although many people think it is in the East. It seems so, as the only European country to the East from Belarus is Russia. The Eastern border of Europe, the Ural Mountains, is situated several thousand kilometers away from Belarus.

The country used to be a part of the Soviet Union, the remnants of which you can still see here. In most of the small towns, and even in some places in Minsk, capital of Belarus, you will still find monuments of Lenin and Soviet signs. Still, after over 25 years of independence, Belarus managed to become a European country with cozy cafes, great festivals, and much better service than it used to be. From the beginning of 2017, more than 80 countries don‚Äôt need a visa to Belarus, you can check if yours is on the list here.
