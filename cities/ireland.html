	Tourism in the Republic of Ireland is one of the biggest contributors to the Economy of the Republic of Ireland, with 9.0 million people visiting the country in 2017, about 1.8 times Ireland's population.[1][2] Each year about ‚Ç¨5bn in revenue is made from economic activities directly related to tourists, accounting for about 4% of GNP and employing over 200,000 people.[3][4] In 2011 alone, Ireland was voted 'Favourite holiday destination in the World' by readers of Frommer's Guide, Lonely Planet listed Ireland as the world's friendliest country and Cork City as one of the top ten cities in the world and the Irish tourist boards website, DiscoverIreland.com, was named the best tourist board website in the world.[5][6] Most tourists visiting Ireland come from the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany and France.<br>The largest city in the Republic of Ireland is Dublin. Due to its proximity to Britain, it was the most important city in Ireland during the Tudor conquest of Ireland and subsequent British Invasions until after 1922 when the Irish Free State was formed. As the British held a presence here for over 500 years, most of the historic buildings from the 1500s on were built by them. As Dublin Airport is located just outside the city, most international visitors to Ireland begin their stay here. Among the main attractions in Dublin are Dublin Castle, the seat of British rule in Ireland until 1922, Phoenix Park, one of the largest inner city parks in the world,[14] The General Post Office, one of Ireland's most famous buildings due to the 1916 Easter rising, Kilmainham Gaol, a former prison turned museum that held and executed the rebels of the 1916 Rising and Trinity College, where the Book of Kells and the Book of Durrow are held.[15] In 2010, Dublin was awarded the title of UNESCO City of Literature, as many famous writers such as James Joyce and Samuel Beckett are from the city.[16]
