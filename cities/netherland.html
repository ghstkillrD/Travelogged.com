The Netherlands (Dutch: Nederland [ÀàneÀêd…ôrl…ënt] (About this soundlisten)), informally Holland,[13] is a country primarily located in Western Europe and partly in the Caribbean, forming the largest constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.[14] In Europe, it consists of 12 provinces that border Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, with maritime borders in the North Sea with those countries and the United Kingdom.[15] In the Caribbean, it consists of three special municipalities: the islands of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba.[h] The country's official language is Dutch, with West Frisian as a secondary official language in the province of Friesland, and English and Papiamentu as secondary official languages in the Caribbean Netherlands.[1] Dutch Low Saxon and Limburgish are recognised regional languages (spoken in the east and southeast respectively), while Sinte Romani and Yiddish are recognised non-territorial languages.[1]

The four largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht.[17] Amsterdam is the country's most populous city and nominal capital,[18] while The Hague holds the seat of the States General, Cabinet and Supreme Court.[19] The Port of Rotterdam is the busiest seaport in Europe, and the busiest in any country outside East Asia and Southeast Asia, behind only China and Singapore.[20] Amsterdam Airport Schiphol is the busiest airport in the Netherlands, and the third busiest in Europe. The country is a founding member of the EU, Eurozone, G10, NATO, OECD and WTO, as well as a part of the Schengen Area and the trilateral Benelux Union. It hosts several intergovernmental organisations and international courts, many of which are centered in The Hague, which is consequently dubbed 'the world's legal capital'.[21]
