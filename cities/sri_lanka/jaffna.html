    <h2>Points of Interest in jaffna</h2><br>

<h3><b>1.casuarina beach<b></h3>
Deriving its name from the abundant casuarina trees found along the shore of the beach, the Casuarina beach with its soft golden sand grains and refreshing blue waters is located at about 20 kilometres from Jaffna. One of the things that lure visitors to the beach is crystal clear water and is free of any sort of pollution.<br>

<h3><b>2.jaffna library<b></h3>
Built in the year of 1933, the Jaffna library is one of the prominent and illustrious buildings in not only the city of Jaffna but also the country of Sri Lanka. The building holds a special place in the hearts of the people.<br>


<h3><b>3.Delft island<b></h3>
Delft Island, locally known as Neduntheevu and situated in northern Sri Lanka, is roughly an hour-long ferry ride away from the mainland. From the remnants of a colonial fort to numerous wild ponies roaming about‚Äî an amalgamation of nature and history awaits you on a trip to this quaint little island. Add to that the coral walls surrounding the houses‚Äîand you‚Äôll feel like you stepped into a strange yet beautiful dream. <br>

<h3><b>4.jaffna fort<b></h3>
Located in Jaffna, its namesake Jaffna Fort is the second largest fort in the country, spanning an area of 55 acres. A former architectural marvel, most of the fort had been reduced to rubble during the Sri Lankan Civil War; fortunately, part restoration has taken place. Jaffna Fort stands today as a testament to the fact that war spares nothing and no one, not even a monument of paramount significance. <br>

<h3><b>5.Fort hammenhiel<b></h3>
The Hammenhiel fort is famous for having a reputation of being a prison. Located on a beautiful location on the mesmerising island between the Kayts and the Karaitivu Islands, the fort was built by the Portuguese as a coast guard. Later it was renovated by the Dutch and then was taken over by the British. The fort was either used as a prison or armoury storage, by its rulers and thus today it has the reputation of being a prison. Fort Hammenhiel is now a hotel open for visitors to explore history through its walls.<br>

<h3><b>6.Dambakola patuna<b></h3>
Dambakola Patuna, or the fort of Jambukola, is one of the most ancient venues of the country. This monument has a rich history, and the port holds a lot of importance and significance for the Buddhist community. The reason that the port is of both a historical and religious significance is that in 249BC, one of the saplings of the Bodhi tree, the tree under which Buddha was enlightened was brought to the country and planted, along with a stupa, but today, no such remains are found. The Sri Lankan navy has built a replica of the stupa and have even planted the Bodhi tree for the Buddhism followers. <br>


<h3><b>7.charty beach<b></h3>
Travel 15 kms from Jaffna to reach the picturesque white-sand Charty Beach. Enjoy a serene day amidst the coconut and palmyrah trees. Charty beach is located in Velanai, the Northern Region of the Island. <br>

<h3><b>8.akkarai beach<b></h3>
Situated 40 minutes from Jaffna, Akkarai Beach is in Thondamanaru. The famous Lord Murugan Temple near the beach and the bridge that offers a panoramic view are the major attractions near the Akkarai Beach. The best part is that the beach is clean, tranquil and not crowded much.<br>
