    <h2>Points of Interest in polonnaruwa</h2><br>

<h3><b>1.Royal Palace<b></h3>
The first group of ruins you meet after entering the ground of the Ancient City is the Royal Palace Group. This group of buildings dates from the period of King Parakramabahu I (1153 ‚Äì 1186). The King`s Royal Palace is a massive structure, measuring 31 m by 13 m, once including 50 rooms supported by 30 columns. Even today it is quite an impressive building, but picture it being seven floors tall with 3 m thick walls, as the archaeologists claim it once was!
Today only some of the walls are left, with holes to hold floor beams for two higher levels. If the building had four more levels above these stone walls, the archaeologists speculate that they must have been made of wood. Impressive building such a big palace in those days without machines!<br>

<h3><b>2.Audience Hall<b></h3>
The king`s Audience Hall is one of the best-preserved structures in the Royal Palace Group, with beautiful stone carved elephants on the walls<br>


<h3><b>3.Shiva Devale<b></h3>
This is the oldest building in Polonnaruwa as it dates back to the brief South Indian Chola dynasty period (around 1070) when the Indian invaders established the city. This is one of the few Hindu temples on the grounds. Because it is among the few buildings built entirely of stone, it is basically in the same condition as when it was built.<br>

<h3><b>4.Pabalu Vehera<b></h3>
Pabalu Vehera, is another typical dagaba, dating back to King Parakramabahu I (1153-1186). This is the third largest dagaba in Polonnaruwa, and in excellent condition.<br>

<h3><b>5.Rankot Vihara<b></h3>
Rankot Vihara is a huge dagaba in excellent condition, of impressive 54 meters tall! It is the largest dagaba in Polonnaruwa, the fourth largest in Sri Lanka, and dates back to King Nissanka Malla (1187 ‚Äì 1196).
In between the ruins and temples, we also found traces of the jungle trying to take over the ancient city. Wandering around these impressive structures that are still in such good condition, it ‚Äòs incredible to think about all the hard work done to restore them since the archaeologists first discovered the Ancient City all covered with trees.<br>

<h3><b>6.Buddha statue at Lankatilaka<b></h3>
The huge Lankatilaka is impressive with its 17 m high walls! Although the roof is gone, it still has a cathedral-like feeling about it, and the aisle leads to a huge standing headless Buddha.<br>

<h3><b>7.Buddha statue at Gal Vihara<b></h3>
Gal Vihara is a group of four beautiful Buddhas in perfect condition, cut from one long slab of granite.<br>
