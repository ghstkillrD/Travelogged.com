	Wellington (MƒÅori: Te Whanganui-a-Tara [t…õ Ààfa≈ãan âi a ta…æa]) is the capital city of New Zealand. It is located at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Remutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island, and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and the Wairarapa. It is the world's southernmost capital of a sovereign state.[3] Wellington features a temperate maritime climate, and is the world's windiest city by average wind speed.[4]

The position of Wellington as capital of New Zealand is not defined in legislation, but established by convention.[5] Its metropolitan area comprises four local authorities: Wellington City, on the peninsula between Cook Strait and Wellington Harbour, contains the central business district; Porirua on Porirua Harbour to the north is notable for its large MƒÅori and Pacific Island communities; Lower Hutt and Upper Hutt are largely suburban areas to the northeast, together known as the Hutt Valley. The Wellington urban area, which only includes urbanised areas within Wellington City, has a population of 212,100 residents as of June 2019.[2] The urban areas of the four local authorties have a combined population of 422,700 residents as of June 2019.[2]
