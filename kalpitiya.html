    <h4>Bordered by the Indian Ocean and the Puttalam Lagoon, comprising of many islands and beaches that rack up some strong winds, the top reason to visit Kalpitiya is for its location, that is prime for the adventure seeker, looking to partake in some serious water sports, along with some amazing sight seeing of what lies beneath the turquoise waters of the area. Try your hand at some invigorating forms of surfing and awe at the very site of the largest mammal, while partaking in some dolphin and whale watching.<br><br>
Located 5 hours up north from the commercial capital of Colombo, Kalpitiya is a remote fishing hamlet that is relatively untouched by mass tourism and serves to be one of the foremost destinations in the country to partake in water sports. Boasting of the largest natural coral reef of the island, along with 14 islands that are untouched by any significant man-made structure, enthrall in the rustic splendour of the abundant marine wildlife that takes refuge in the reefs and sit back, relax and enjoy the views of the serene Indian Ocean.<br>
