			<p class = "ad_description" align = "left">A lockdown imposed a month ago to battle the COVID-19 
			pandemic has created greater freedom for wild animals in Sri Lanka’s popular national parks, 
			generally stressed by over-visitation and unregulated feeding of wildlife.
			Park elephants thriving on food offered by visitors are now seen returning to their old diets 
			and exploring for food more freely.
			As possibilities for poaching increase, the Department of Wildlife Conservation has enhanced 
			its anti-poaching activities.
			Experts are urging the authorities to use the lockdown period to reset the country’s wildlife 
			tourism practices by imposing better controls and management.

					<h3>Taj Mahal is Reopen After 6 Months</h3>
					<img class = "pop_ad_logo" src = "images/taj_ad1.jpg" align = "center">
					<p>More than six months after it was closed down for visitors in the wake of the 
					pandemic, the Taj Mahal will open its doors to the public from September 21. Vasant 
					Swarnkar, Superintending Archaeologist of the Archaeological Survey of India’s Agra 
					Circle, confirmed this to The Indian Express. However, he said that there will be a 
					cap of 5,000 on the number of visitors allowed per day.
					Even as all other ASI-protected monuments in Agra were allowed to open from 
					September 1, Taj Mahal and Agra Fort remained shut as per the district 
					administration’s orders as they were located close to containment zones.
					When the Taj opens on September 21 morning, visitors will have to follow all 
					guidelines issued by the Centre such as social distancing and hand sanitisation, 
					said Swarnkar. “Masks are mandatory to enter the monuments and all tickets must 
					be purchased online. Ticket counters won’t open,” he said.</p>

					The monument was “fully” evacuated shortly after midday as a precautionary measure

					The site reopened two hours later after the police had carried out checks in and 
					around the monument. The Paris police confirmed that officers did not find anything 
					suspicious, but declined to provide more details about the anonymous call.
					The Eiffel Tower, an icon of the French capital, is visited by millions every year. 
					It was forced to close for months at the start of the coronavirus pandemic but

					<h3>Emirates Is Now Serving Almost 100 Destinations</h3>

					<p>Emirates revealed yesterday that it will return to the destinations of Entebbe 
					in Uganda as well as Muscat in Oman in the next few days. This will mean that the 
					airline serves up to 94 destinations out of 161 total before the crisis. The airline 
					said,
					“Emirates is gradually resuming operations and rebuilding its network to provide 
					more travel opportunities, sparing no effort to ensure the highest standards of 
					health and safety for its customers and employees at every travel touchpoint.”
					Services to Entebbe, Uganda will start on October 1st and will operate return on 
					Thursdays, Fridays, and Sundays. This will be the 20th destination for the carrier 
					in Africa, allowing passengers to travel onwards to the USA, Asia, and throughout 
					the Middle East.
					Emirates flight EK 729 will depart Dubai at 1030hrs, arriving in Entebbe at 1500hrs. 
					The return flight, EK 730, will depart Entebbe at 1700hrs, arriving in Dubai at 2325hrs.
					As for Muscat, Oman, this route will start operating on October 2nd. It will 
					operate only twice a week on Sundays and Fridays. The flight is short and will be 
					a quick trip for passengers, saving them a drive through the desert.</p>

					<h3>Booking.com introduces weekly and monthly rate plans</h3>
					<img class = "pop_ad_logo" src = "images/booking_ad.jpg" align = "center">
					<p>According to the platform, the weekly rate plan requires a minimum length of 
					stay of seven nights, and for the monthly rate plan, a length of stay of 28 nights 
					is the minimum requirement. Its partners can set them as foundational rate plans 
					with the flexibility to provide them based on their business needs, time of the 
					year and cancellation policy of choice.
					In addition, Booking is also launching a pilot programme in select cities around the 
					world to enable guests to book stays that are longer than 30 nights in the same 
					reservation.
					As various traveller segments such as traditional business travellers, digital 
					nomads, expatriates and students increasingly seek out longer stays in times of 
					such turbulence, and asset classes such as vacation hotels and hotels are seemingly 
					set up to capitalise on the extended stay segment.
					That is the view of Gianbattista Vespucci, commercial director at Booking.com, when 
					quoting a report from Kalibri Labs and The Highland Group.
					The report highlights how guests staying seven consecutive nights or longer are 
					spending 57 per cent more at traditional hotels than guests at serviced 
					apartments / extended-stay hotels. Additionally, its findings show that traditional 
					hotels are hosting 28 per cent more extended-stay room nights than serviced 
					apartments, further demonstrating consumer appetite for long-stay product offerings.</p>

					<p>Sri Lankan authorities announced Wednesday that they will offer livestreams 
					from the island nation’s wildlife parks, in a move to help revive a tourism 
					industry that has been decimated by the coronavirus pandemic.
					The government’s Tourism Promotion Bureau said livestreaming will initially cover 
					four national parks to showcase the South Asian country’s exotic wildlife, 
					including leopards, bears, elephants, crocodiles and birds.
					The project will offer eight wildlife streaming video sessions of one hour each 
					which will be shown on social media platforms and shared further through 
					broadcast media, the bureau said in a statement.
					Tourism in Sri Lanka — which was named the world’s top travel destination for 
					2019 by Lonely Planet — has suffered severely due to the coronavirus, with 
					authorities indefinitely postponing the reopening of the country to foreign 
					tourists.The government had planned to reopen to tourists on Aug. 1, but 
					shelved the plan when a new cluster of COVID-19 patients emerged in July.</p>

					<p>The first flight will have about 120 tourists from Guangzhou, flying directly

					Thailand has kept coronavirus infections low with just 3,559 cases and 59 deaths, 
					but its economy has taken a hit from a ban on foreign visitors since April and is 
					expected to contract 8.5% this year.
					Government spokeswoman Traisulee Traisoranakul expects 1,200 tourists in the first 
					month, generating about 1 billion baht ($31.55 million) in revenue and 12.4 billion 
					baht over one year, drawing in 14,400 tourists.
					Nationalities permitted to enter will be from countries deemed low risk by the 
					government, which will keep tabs on them.</p>
